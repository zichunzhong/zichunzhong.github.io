<P><B>These instructions explain how to create and run GLUT applications in the 
  computer labs using Visual C++ 2005/2008/2010. Some instructions for installing and using 
  the GLUT and OpenGL libraries for personal computers or computers without the 
  proper files installed can be found <A

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When creating an OpenGL\GLUT application, no OS code is required since everything 
  is, conveniently enough, handled by the GLUT libraries. When using Visual C++ 
  2005, the best way to start is with a bare-bones Win32 Console Application. 
  Selecting File &gt; New will allow you to create a simple Win32 Console Application 
  Project.</P>

<P>Give the project a name and location and select the default settings from then 
  on. You'll be faced with a empty Visual Studio 2005 project. </P>

<P>If Visual Studio does not give you a prepared C++ source file you can create 
  one and add it to your project. When creating your source and header files, 
  make sure to include the &lt;GL/glut.h&gt; header file. In order to avoid conflicts 
  between header files, you should make &lt;GL/glut.h&gt; or &lt;glut.h&gt; the 
  <I>last</I> header file you include - if it's listed before others, it sometimes 
  will give an error about function redefinition. This header includes all other 
  necessary headers required to use OpenGL in Windows.</P>
<P>The following steps may not be necessary in the computer labs, but if you run 
  into problems, you should follow them. The only thing necessary to compile a 
  GLUT application is to link to the necessary libraries. These are OPENGL32.LIB, 
  GLU32.LIB, and GLUT32.LIB. Select Project &gt; "ProjectName" Properties and 
  move to the Linker folder. You can enter the necessary files into the Additional 
  Dependencies textbox.</P>
